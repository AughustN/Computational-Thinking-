# 💡 2. Problem Definition

*Core problem:*  
How to detect and count vehicles at city junctions in near-real time, convert those counts into a road-graph traffic flow, and predict congestion on each road segment using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), then surface alerts with red/yellow/green states.

- **Why vision?**
  - Fixed cameras are non-intrusive and can extract rich traffic parameters beyond simple counts (class, lane, speed proxies).
- **Why GNN?**
  - Congestion is spatiotemporal: neighboring links/junctions influence each other; graph models capture these dependencies.

### Stakeholders
- *Traffic Operations Center:* Needs timely R/Y/G alerts on interpretable segments.
- *Data/ML Team:* Maintains detector, tracker, and GNN; monitors drift.

### Objectives
- Deploy YOLOv8 vehicle detection (car, motorbike, bicycle, bus/truck).
- Track and count vehicles per lane/movement; estimate per-interval flow.
- Build a directed road graph (nodes=junctions, edges=movements/links).
- Train a spatiotemporal GNN to predict short-term congestion per edge.
- Baseline and report accuracy (mAP, counting MAE, alert precision/recall).

### Input Data

*External/Static*
- Junction/road geometry (GIS/OSM), lane polygons & virtual count lines.
- Camera calibration (homography) for lane/movement mapping.

*Live Streams*
- RTSP video from fixed cameras (≥1080p preferred; stable mount & AoI).

*Derived/Model Inputs*
- Per-interval counts by class (car, motorbike, bicycle, bus/truck).
- Edge features for GNN: recent flows, occupancy proxies, historical averages.
- (Optional) Exogenous: rain/temp, hour/day seasonality.

### Expected Output
- Time-stamped per-movement/edge flow table (by class).
- Segment/junction congestion score ∈ [0,1] → {Green, Yellow, Red}.
- API + live map with color states; exportable CSV/Parquet.
- Model metrics report (mAP@50, counting MAE/MAPE, alert P/R/F1).

### Constraints
- Occlusion, shadows, night/glare, and camera shake degrade vision.
- Domain shift across junctions/cameras; few-shot tuning may be needed.
- GNN depends on reliable flows; upstream count errors propagate.
- Privacy & policy: no face/plate storage; only aggregates persist.
- Edge compute & bandwidth constraints at some sites.

## 🔸 3. Guiding Questions

### 3.1 What do we know?
- Vision can deliver counts + classes; feasible at scale with good placement.
- YOLOv8 handles multi-scale vehicles; light pre/post-processing helps.
- Congestion prediction benefits from ML/DL with exogenous signals.
- Simple tree/MLP baselines are strong for discrete congestion labels.

### 3.2 What do we want?
- `detect_vehicles_yolov8()` → per-frame boxes+classes+conf.
- `track_and_count()` → lane/movement-aware tracks; interval counts.
- `build_flow_graph()` → assemble edge features from counts.
- `gnn_predict_congestion()` → short-term edge congestion score.
- `alert_router()` → thresholds + hysteresis → R/Y/G; push to API/DB.

### 3.3 What are the rules or constraints?
- One camera per junction should cover all movements (minimal blind spots).
- Counting via *crossing* virtual lines; de-dup with track IDs + cooldown.
- GNN trained on rolling windows (e.g., past 15–30 min → next 5–10 min).
- No raw video retention beyond transient buffers; store only aggregates.

### 3.4 What’s missing?
- Night/rain robustness; may need IR/low-light cameras or extra fine-tuning.
- Ground-truth flow for evaluation (short audit campaigns).
- Reliable GIS homographies for every camera.
